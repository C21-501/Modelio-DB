## Project Description
The project involves the development of a custom databaseScheme management system using Java. The system aims to provide functionalities such as data storage, retrieval, manipulation, and querying. The team will be using Java's built-in data structures, libraries, and frameworks to implement the databaseScheme functionalities.

## Goals
Design and implement the core functionalities of the databaseScheme system.
Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the databaseScheme.
Ensure the reliability and efficiency of data storage and retrieval processes.
Test the databaseScheme system thoroughly to identify and fix any issues or bugs.
Document the project thoroughly to facilitate future maintenance and development.

## Project Structure
The project will be structured into multiple modules, each responsible for different aspects of the databaseScheme system such as data storage, indexing, querying, and user interface. The team will collaborate closely to ensure seamless integration of these modules into the final product.

## Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language for developing the databaseScheme system.
Git: Version control system for managing the project's source code.
GitHub: Hosting platform for collaboration and project management.
